            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Richard Huynh, and I am a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I am pursuing a major in Information Science with a minor in Digital Studies. Through my coursework, I've developed a strong foundation in how people interact with information, technology, and digital platforms, and I am excited to continue building my skills in areas such as IT, web development, and web design. My long-term goal after college is to pursue a career where I can combine technical problem-solving with creativitywhether that's through designing user-friendly websites, developing digital solutions, or supporting organizations through IT systems and services.</p>


            <p>Outside of academics, I'm passionate about music and fitness. I enjoy DJing, going to concerts, and discovering new artists, which allows me to stay connected to creativity and culture. I also dedicate time to the gym, where I've learned discipline, consistency, and goal-settingvalues I carry into my academic and professional life. I am motivated to keep growing my technical expertise and look forward to applying my skills in a professional setting where I can contribute, learn, and make a positive impact.</p>
